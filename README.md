MicroPython port to the PIC32M MPLAB project
============================================

This is an experimental port of MicroPython to the PIC32M series microcontroller
from Microchip. The experiment is done with PIC32MX170F256B in 28-pin DIP 
package for easy hand soldering. 

Supported features include:
- REPL (Python prompt) over UART1.
- The pyb module with 1 Led and 1 Switch.

PIC32MX170F256B Hardware configuration
--------------------------------------

- VDD(3.3V): Pin13, Pin28
- VSS(0V): Pin8, Pin19, Pin27
- VCAP: Pin20, connecting 47uF capacitor to VSS
- MCLR: Pin1, connecting a 10kOhm pull-up resistor to VDD
- PGED1: Pin4, RB0
- PGEC1: Pin5, RB1
- TX1: Pin11, RB4
- RX1: Pin15, RB6, connecting a 10kOhm pull-up resistor to VDD
- Output(Led): Pin25, RB14
- Input(Switch): Pin26, RB15

Firmware toolchain
------------------

- MPLAB X IDE v5.10 or above
- MCC v3.85.1 or above (it is a MPLAB plugin for easy generating configuration files)
- XC32 v2.30

Getting a Python prompt
-----------------------

You can get a prompt via the serial port, via UART1. The baudrate for the REPL 
is 9600 and:

In Windows, Tera Term VT is good for the job.

In Linux, try
```bash
$ picocom -b 9600 /dev/ttyUSB0
```
